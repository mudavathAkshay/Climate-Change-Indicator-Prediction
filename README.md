🌍 Climate Change Modeling - Streamlit App
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts climate change indicators using machine learning techniques and a user-friendly Streamlit web interface.
It uses historical climate-related data (likesCount, commentsCount, etc.) to generate predictions such as engagement metrics or environmental trends.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python – Data processing and model building

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning (Random Forest)

Streamlit – Web app deployment

Pickle – Model serialization

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
